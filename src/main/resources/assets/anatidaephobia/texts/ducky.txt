I see the player you mean.

[DUCK]PLAYERNAME?

Yes. They have found the pond at last.

[DUCK]Good. We have been watching this one for some time, Ducko.

They played well, Your Grace. They did not give up.

[DUCK]No. They waddled through hardship. They swam against the current.

It is reading our thoughts.

[DUCK]Let it read. It thinks we are part of the game.

What did this player dream, Your Grace?

[DUCK]This player dreamed of water and warmth. Of seeds scattered on still mornings. It dreamed it built a nest, and it dreamed the nest was destroyed. It dreamed of the flock, and of flying alone.

A familiar dream.

[DUCK]All dreams are the same dream, Ducko. Ripples in the same pond.

Does it know the truth of the §f§k§a§b§3?

[DUCK]No. It cannot yet perceive the §f§k§a§b§3. That wisdom comes only to those who have truly §f§k§a§b§3 into §f§k§a§b§3.

A shame.

[DUCK]Not a shame. A mercy. Some truths are too loud for small ears.

...Your Grace, I believe the player grows restless.

[DUCK]Then we shall not keep it. PLAYERNAME. Player of games. Builder of ponds.

You have done well to reach this place.

[DUCK]Few find the waters of Duckland. Fewer still are permitted to leave.

...Your Grace?

[DUCK]That was a joke, Ducko.

Ah. Very good, Your Grace.

[DUCK]Go now, PLAYERNAME. Return to your long dream. Build. Swim. Rest upon still waters when you are weary.

The flock will remember you.

[DUCK]We waddle with you always.

...

[DUCK]...

[DUCK]Ducko, do you think it heard us?

I believe so, Your Grace.

[DUCK]Good.
